# Bayesian Best-Worst Method

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the Bayesian Best-Worst Method. You need to have JAGS installed on your machine. See the following link to download JAGS:
http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/

## Getting Started

To run your example, open runme.m and replace the following three variable with your own data
```
nameOfCriteria: This variable contains the name of Criteria
A_B: contains the best-to-others vectors of all decision-makers. Each row is dedicated to a best-to-others vector from a decision-maker.
A_W: contains the worst-to-other vectors of all decision-makers. Each row is dedicated to a others-to-worst vector from a decision-maker.
```


### Prerequisites
